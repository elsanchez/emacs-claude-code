- Thunder icon issue RESOLVED - working perfectly
- All changes committed and pushed (commit b5be94c)
- Repository clean, all tests passing (91/91)
- Temporary fix files still present:
  - fix-auto-response.el
  - ecc-state-detection-patch.el
- Ready to start Phase 3 tomorrow (June 1)

## 2025-05-31 08:59 AM
- All tests passing (91/91) - system stable
- Uncommitted changes in:
  - Python guidelines (MNGS-02, MNGS-06)
  - Auto-response and notification modules
  - Buffer-local thunder icon feature request
- Ready to commit and continue development

## 2025-05-31 1:00 PM
- Removed flashing behavior from thunder icon
- Now âš¡ CLAUDE stays displayed continuously (no flash/disappear)
- Icon only shows on buffers with auto-response enabled
- Added function to remove thunder icon when needed
- Cleaned up unused flash timer code

## 2025-05-31 12:55 PM
- Fixed notification flash to be properly buffer-local
- Now âš¡ CLAUDE only appears on buffers with auto-response enabled
- Modified ecc-notification.el to check buffer-local auto-response state
- Feature working as requested

## 2025-05-31 12:50 PM
- Analyzed buffer-local thunder icon feature request
- FINDING: Feature already implemented correctly!
- Both [AUTO] and âš¡ CLAUDE are buffer-local
- If seeing global display, likely a bug to investigate
- Created feature request documentation

## 2025-05-31 08:15 AM
- Created URGENT-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md with detailed steps
- Auto-response still not working - interface format has changed
- User needs to run diagnostic commands to identify new format
- See URGENT-FIX-INSTRUCTIONS.md for immediate help

## 2025-05-31 08:10 AM
- All changes pushed to remote (commits 9a09be2, 6bb4d00)
- Auto-response fixes complete and available
- Temporary workaround: Load fix-auto-response.el

## 2025-05-31 07:55 AM
- Created temporary fixes for auto-response:
  1. `ecc-state-detection-patch.el` - More aggressive pattern matching
  2. `fix-auto-response.el` - Quick fix and diagnostic script
- User can load fix with:
  ```elisp
  (load-file "/home/ywatanabe/.dotfiles/.emacs.d/lisp/emacs-claude-code/fix-auto-response.el")
  ```
- This should restore auto-response functionality

## 2025-05-31 07:40 AM

  1. Mode-line indicator stops pulsing
  2. Auto-response not sending responses
- Implemented `ecc-refresh-timers` function
